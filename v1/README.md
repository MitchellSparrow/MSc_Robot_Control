# Overview

The following folder contains two main sub-folders, namely the machine learning folder and the robot control folder. The contents of each of these folders are disussed below:

## a.) Machine Learning Folder

A folder which contains all of the machine learning code for both the Semantic Segmentation Model as well as the LSTM model.

## b.) Robot Control Folder

A folder which contains the main program of the project, which controls the robot, interfaces with the camera system and runs the machine learning models which allows the program to make predictions on the objects that the robot is maniuplating.
