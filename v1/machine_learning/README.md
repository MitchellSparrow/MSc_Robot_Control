# Machine Learning Code

The following folder contains the two main machine learning elements to the project, being the semantic segmentation model and the LSTM model.

The following image shows a flow diagram of the full machine learning pipeline used to predict the physical properties of objects. The input images from a video camera are first fed into the image segmentation model before being passed as a series into the time series model (LSTM) which makes the final prediction on the physical properties of the object
